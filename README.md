# About

In December 2024, I joined [Jeremy Howard's](https://jeremy.fast.ai) new course, [Solve It With Code](https://solveit.fast.ai), by [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai). This unique program introduces a fresh approach to coding that combines iterative problem-solving with AI. It emphasizes building foundational skills without requiring a background in data structures or computer science. The course focuses on using Python (with minimal external libraries) and teaches an engineering technique that integrates AI as a collaborative tool ([source](https://solveit.fast.ai/course-details)).

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges, crafted using the engineering process taught in the course.
While this repository does not document the engineering process itself, it showcases the Python solutions to the challenges. The solutions are organized in the [solutions](./solutions) folder, and the input data for each challenge is stored in the [data](./data) folder.

__Note:__ The input data for each challenge differs by user. If you are using this project as a template for your own solutions, you will need to log in to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) website to download your personal puzzle input data and use it to replace the existing files in the [./data/](./data/) folder. To update the [table of challenges](#table-of-challenges), read these [instructions](#generating-this-readme) below.

## Generating this README

Generating the `README.md` file updates the cells of the challenges table based on the metadata from the `challenges.json` file the content (!) of the solution files automatically.

__Note:__ The time and space complexity are extracted from the solution files by looking for lines that start with `Time complexity:` and `Space complexity:` respectively. Please ensure that these lines are present in your solution files as well. Here are some valid examples:
```python
"""
...
Time complexity: O(...)
Space complexity: O(...)
...
"""
```
or
```python
...
# Time complexity: O(...)
...
# Space complexity: O(...)
...
```

To generate the `README.md` file, follow these steps:

#### 0. Prerequisites

- Clone this repository.
- Ensure that Docker is installed and running on your system.

#### 1. Make the Bash Script Executable

Run the following command to make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x ./generate_readme_using_docker.sh
```

#### 2. Build and Run the Docker Container

```bash
./generate_readme_using_docker.sh
```

- This will build the Docker image each time it is run to avoid file caching issues.
- It will then run the Docker container to execute the `generate_readme.py` script, which generates the `README.md` file and overwrites the exiting `README.md` file in your local directory.

#### 3. Verify the Output

Once the container execution is finished, you should see the updated `README.md` file in the same directory where you ran the script.
